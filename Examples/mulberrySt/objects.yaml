# Assign Csound instrument nubmers to objects.
# The numbers correspond to the instruments defined in csound.csd
# If multiple instrtuments are assigned to an object, an instrument will be randomly selected from the list.
# Setting an object to nothing will cause it to never play an instrument
# Setting an empty list ([]) will cause it to play the default instrument
# Setting default to an empty list will make it not play any instrument
